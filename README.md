# Teleport Beams - VS Code Extension

Manage and connect to Teleport Beams directly from VS Code. Create, monitor, and SSH into ephemeral sandbox VMs built for agentic workloads.

This repository contains the source for the extension — there is no separate server component. Everything is driven through the `tsh` CLI (see `src/tsh.ts`), which the extension shells out to for beam lifecycle, file access, git operations, and cluster status.

## Features

- **Clusters panel** — shows all logged-in Teleport profiles (active + inactive), with roles, logins, and session expiry
- **Beams sidebar** — list, create, rename, and delete beams
- **File explorer** — browse and edit beam files without SSH, with live change indicators as files are modified on the remote beam
- **Agent Events** — chronological stream of agent session events, auto-detected from the most recently modified JSONL transcript under any `~/.<tool>` dotdir (Claude Code's schema is parsed natively; other agents get a best-effort generic view)
- **Remote-SSH** — one-click VS Code Remote-SSH connection to any beam, with automatic `~/.ssh/config` management
- **Terminal** — open a `tsh` SSH session in the integrated terminal
- **Source Control** — native SCM panel backed by the beam's git with QuickDiff gutter indicators against `HEAD`.
- **File decorations** — git status badges (modified/added/untracked) on files in the beam file explorer
- **Local Debug Containers** — mirror a beam's workspace into a local Docker container, kept in sync automatically while you work, with rebuild/teardown controls
- **Publish / Unpublish** — expose a beam's port 8080 app publicly and copy its URL
- **Run on Beam** — run a command on a beam, publish its port, and open it in the browser
- **Export** — download beam files as a `tar.gz` archive
- **GitHub credentials** — PAT, OAuth (`gh` browser flow), or Teleport Git Proxy authentication for git operations on a beam, with saved preferences for auto-setup on new beams

## Prerequisites

- A Beams account — sign up at [beams.run](https://www.beams.run/)
- [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/) (`tsh` CLI) installed and in your PATH
- Logged in to your Teleport cluster: `tsh login --proxy=<cluster>.beams.sh`
- Docker (only required if you use Local Debug Containers)
- VS Code 1.85+

## Install from VSIX

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/cassiebreviu/beam-vs-code.git
cd beam-vs-code
npm install
npm run package

# Install the extension (filename matches the version in package.json)
code --install-extension teleport-beams-<version>.vsix
```

Or in VS Code: Extensions panel > `...` menu > "Install from VSIX..." and select the `.vsix` file.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # watch mode — recompiles on save
npm run compile        # one-shot TypeScript compile
npm test               # compile + run tests (node:test)
npm run package        # compile + vsce package → teleport-beams-<version>.vsix
npm run install-local  # install the built .vsix into VS Code
```

There is no linter configured; `tsc` is the primary correctness check. Tests live in `test/` (currently covering SSH config repair logic).

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host (reads `.vscode/launch.json`).

## Usage

1. Open the **Beams** panel in the activity bar (left sidebar). It has four views: **Clusters**, **Beams**, **Files**, and **Agent Events**.
2. Click **Login** (key icon) if not already authenticated.
3. Click **Create Beam** (+) to spin up a new VM, optionally applying your saved GitHub credentials and enabling a local debug container.
4. Click a beam to select it — the Files and Agent Events panels populate, and SCM/git integration activates if the beam has a git repo.
5. Use the inline buttons on each beam:
   - `$(remote)` — open a Remote-SSH session in a new VS Code window
   - `$(globe)` — open the beam's published app in the browser
   - `$(terminal)` — open a `tsh` SSH terminal
6. Right-click a beam for more actions: open files, publish/unpublish, export, setup GitHub, rename, delete, and local debug container controls (when enabled for that beam).
